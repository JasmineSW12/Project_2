        <h1 id="question"> Giving some information on her family’s background, Miss Roylott informs you and 
            Watson that her stepfather Dr. Grimesby Roylott (who married her mother,  after his visit in India) has 
            her deceased mothers inheritance (Mrs. Stoner) but if her daughters ever got married he 
            would have to pay them yearly from that inheritance. Miss Roylott explains to you and Watson that
            she believes that her twin sister Julia was murdered shortly before her wedding date about two 
            years ago. She had heard a scream from Julia’s bedroom and rushed in to see what the problem was. 
            She found that Julia was greatly distraught and that she soon fell to the ground in a seizure, 
            before she passed she said this while pointing to Dr. Roylott’s room: “It was the band! 
            The speckled band!” As she continues to tell you details, you find out that her sister Julia 
            had a charred stump of a match found in her right hand and in her left hand a match box. 
            What could this mean? </h1>

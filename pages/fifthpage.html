        <h1 id="question">Miss Roylott explains all these things to you because she fears her own 
            life is in danger for she is soon to be married herself. She even informs you that she is
            staying in her late sister's room because her own room is being renovated and apparently she 
            heard some odd whistling outside her room, the same whistling her sister was hearing before
            her death (a low hissing sound). She also mentions that her sister could smell Dr. Roylottâ€™s cigar 
            smoke from her room. But you are worried that she hasn't told you everything because you find 
            on one of her wrists five bold marks in the shape of a hand. What could this mean?

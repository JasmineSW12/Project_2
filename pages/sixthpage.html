        <h1 id="question">After she lives, her stepfather pays you a visit. He threatens you to 
            stay away from his daughter and their family. You and Watson are unbothered by the Doctor's
             angry bouts and passively tell him to leave. After he leaves, you and Watson continue to 
             discuss the case. You have deduced that Julia's room had  a ventilator in it 
             before even visiting the home. Why do you infer this?

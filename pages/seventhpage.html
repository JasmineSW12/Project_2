        <h1 id="question">In going to the house to investigate and even spending the night in 
            Julia’s room (while Miss Roylott stayed in her own room) to further investigate, 
            you and Watson come to the conclusion that it was Dr. Roylott who killed Julia. 
            Why do you think Dr. Roylott killed Julia? Pick one previous clue to answer 
            this question.</h1>

# Project_2
A text-based msytery game based on the Sherlock Holmes story "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" by Conan Doyle. In this game users will pick choices based on the summary of an event in the story and a question that will follow that event. These summaries help the user to better understand how a detective like Sherlock Holmes comes to his various conclusions, so the summaries should be read attentively. All choices are worth 1 point which would equal to a total of 5 point (5 summaries/questions). If the user gets all the clues correct they get to know how the murder did the crime and if not they only get some of the story which leaves the users with two opposite endings depending upon their choices.
